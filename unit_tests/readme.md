TL, DR: just follow [tests](tests) folder as examples.

1. Run 'make' to build desktop binary.
1. Execute fome_test binary on your PC/Mac, it's expected to say SUCCESS and not fail :) Googletest will also print results summary.
1. To run only one test, run like this: `build/fome_test --gtest_filter=MyTestName`

In this folder we have rusEFI unit tests using https://github.com/google/googletest

Unit tests are not aware of ChibiOS or ARM or else, they are just plain C/C++ which you build for your desktop, not your MCU.

# Triggers Images

Trigger images generation is still a two-step manual process:

Step 1: Invoke unit_tests. One of the unit_tests artifacts is triggers.txt

Step 2: Once we have triggers.txt updated by unit_tests we can invoke firmware/gen_trigger_images.bat in order
to generate actual trigger images.
