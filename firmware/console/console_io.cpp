 *
 * rusEFI can communicate with external universe via native USB or some sort of TTL mode
 * We have an interesting situation with TTL communication channels, we have
 * 1) SERIAL - this one was implemented first simply because the code was readily available (works on stm32)
 *    this one is most suitable for streaming HAL API
 *    this one is not great since each byte requires an IRQ and with enough IRQ delay we have a risk of data loss
 * 2) UART DMA - the best one since FIFO buffer reduces data loss (works on stm32)
 *    We have two halves of DMA buffer - one is used for TTL while rusEFI prepares next batch of data in the other side.
 *    We need idle support in order to not wait for the complete buffer to get full in order to recieve a message.
 *    Back when we were implementing this STM32_DMA_CR_HTIE was not available in ChibiOS driver so we have added it.
 *    we have custom rusEFI changes to ChibiOS HAL driver v1
 *    F7 uses driver v2 which currently does not have rusEFI changes.
 *    open question if fresh ChibiOS is better in this regard.
 * 3) UART this one is useful on platforms with hardware FIFO buffer like Kinetis.
 *    stm32 does not have such buffer so for stm32 UART without DMA has no advantages
