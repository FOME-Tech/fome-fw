How to use this file:
- When making a change to the firmware that users should know about, add it to the
	appropriate section (breaking/added/fixed) in the next release.
- If it's something interesting or breaking, make a post about it on the forum! We want users
	to find out about changes before they have to get help because their car won't start.
