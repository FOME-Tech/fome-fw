# TunerStudio (TS)

This directory contains the initialization and configuration files for the
FOME interface to TunerStudio.

The primary contents are a set `fome_*.ini` initialization files, used to
configure TunerStudio to setup and monitor a specific ECU board.  These are
the only files a typical end user needs.

The `translations` directory contains non-English-language translations
for TunerStudio.

In TunerStudio some fields have little question mark on the left of the name for additional field tips.
Those tips are defined in `../integration/rusefi_config.txt`

The initialization files are automatically generated from a combination
of input files located both in this directory and in the board-specific
directories .

`fome_*.ini` files are generated based on the following four inputs:
1) `rusefi_config.txt` contains configuration region definition in proprietary text format.
2) `tunerstudio.template.ini` contains the UI - all the menus and dialogs. UI definition starts at `menuDialog = main`
line - here you will see all top level menus defined with internal IDs and visible text labels.
3) `mapping.yaml` is a minor detail related to how pins are named in drop downs
4) `prepend.txt` is a minor detail which allows you to hide elements of the UI using `@@if_XXX` syntax.


The combined file is generated by ConfigDefinition.jar tool.
On Linux this may be run with `gen_config.sh`.


Q: how do I offer my changes to TS project?

A: please PR only source files (tunerstudio.template.ini & rusefi_config.txt). Once merged, gen_config.sh would be executed automatically and results would be pushed by automation.
